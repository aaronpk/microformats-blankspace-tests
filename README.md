Microformats Whitespace Tests
=============================

Some test cases for whitespace handling in Microformats.

Compiling Results
-----------------

Run the parser against all the tests by running:

```
php run.php
```

That will send the test HTML to each parser, and store the results in `results/output.json`. It will also compile the results into an HTML file `results/results.html` which you can view in a browser.
